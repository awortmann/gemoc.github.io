## 1. GEMOC Studio Overview

The GEMOC Studio is an Eclipse package that contains components supporting the GEMOC methodology for building and composing executable DSMLs.

It includes the two workbenches:

  * The GEMOC Language Workbench, intended to be used by language designers: it allows building and composing new executable DSMLs.
  * The GEMOC Modeling Workbench, intended to be used by domain designers: it allows creating and executing models conformant to executable DSMLs.

Each workbench is delivered with some basic illustrating examples that can be installed from Eclipse (File>New>Example...)


## 2. Features

This section describes all the features available in the studio. Those features fall into three categories:

  * GEMOC Workbench features: the two main workbench features provide integration support for the methodology.
  * GEMOC main features : the set of components used by the GEMOC methodology (defining a new language or using a workbench language)
  * Additional features: other components that are integrated to the studio to ease the development of modelling frameworks.

For sake of simplification, features that are technically deployed as several Eclipse features are grouped for presentation.


### 2.1 GEMOC Workbench Features

This section presents the two main features of the Studio. These features plays a specific role in the studio, they organize the use of the other provided components.


#### 2.1.1 GEMOC Language Workbench
