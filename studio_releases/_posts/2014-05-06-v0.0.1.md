## 1. GEMOC Studio Overview

The GEMOC Studio is an eclipse package that contains components supporting the GEMOC methodology for building and composing executable DSMLs.

It includes the two workbenches:

  *     The GEMOC Language Workbench: intended to be used by language designers (aka domain experts), it allows to build and compose new executable DSMLs.
  *     The GEMOC Modeling Workbench: intended to be used by domain designers, it allows to create and execute models conformant to executable DSMLs.

Each workbench comes with some basic illustrating examples that can be installed from eclipse (File>New>Example...)

## 2. Features in GEMOC Studio 0.0.1 (2014-05-06)

This section describes all the features available in the studio. There is two categories of features :

  * GEMOC main features : all the components used by the studio user while he follows the GEMOC process (defining a new language or using a workbench language)
  * Additional features : all other components that are integrated to the studio to ease the development of modeling frameworks.

### 2.1 GEMOC Main Features

This section lists the features that are explicitly used by the current GEMOC process.

#### 2.1.8 TESL

TESL is a tagged event solver. It comes with a language to write the specification. It is studied in Gemoc as a possible alternative to timesquare solver.

Website : <http://wwwdi.supelec.fr/software/ModHelX/>

Documentation : Not yet available

#### 2.1.9 Timesquare

TimeSquare is an MDK (Model Development Kit) provided as a set of Eclipse plugins that can be downloaded or installed over an existing Eclipse. TimeSquare  is based on the formal Event Constraint Language (ECL), which allows the manipulation of logical time. An ECL model is defining the link between the couple AS/DSA and the MoCC.

Website : <http://timesquare.inria.fr/>

Documentation : Not yet available

#### 2.1.10XTend

Xtend is a statically-typed programming language which translates to comprehensible Java source code. Syntactically and semantically Xtend has its roots in the Java programming language.

Website : <https://www.eclipse.org/xtend>

Documentation : <https://www.eclipse.org/xtend/documentation.html>

#### 2.1.11 XText

Xtext offers to create textual syntaxes and associated editor.

Website : <http://www.eclipse.org/Xtext/>

Documentation : <http://www.eclipse.org/Xtext/documentation.html>

### 2.2  Additional Features

This section lists the features that have been added to the studio in order to ease the development.

#### 2.2.1 Acceleo

Acceleo is a pragmatic implementation of the Object Management Group (OMG) MOF Model to Text Language (MTL) standard.

Website : <http://www.eclipse.org/acceleo/>

Documentation : http://www.eclipse.org/acceleo/support/

#### 2.2.2 ATL

ATL (ATL Transformation Language) is a model transformation language and toolkit. In the field of Model-Driven Engineering (MDE), ATL provides ways to produce a set of target models from a set of source models.

In a nutshell this project provides:

  * a framework you can easily reuse and extend to compare instances of your models
  * a tool integrated in the Eclipse IDE to see the differences and merge them.

It includes a generic comparison engine and the ability to export differences in a model patch. It is integrated with the Eclipse Team API meaning that it enables collaborative work on models using CVS, SVN and GIT.
