## About the Workshop

Modern software-intensive systems serve diverse stakeholder groups and thus must address a variety of stakeholder concerns. These concern spaces are often associated with specialized description languages and technologies that are based on concern-specific problem and solution concepts. Software developers are thus faced with the challenging task of integrating the different languages and associated technologies used to produce software artifacts in the different concern spaces.

GEMOC 2013 is a full-day workshop that will bring together researchers and practitioners in the modeling languages community to discuss the challenges associated with integrating multiple, heterogeneous modeling languages.

Throughout reputation scientific research it is usually asserted that the good findings originate from experts who requested his or her self the correct questions. Not only because of this, many of these individuals were fortunate and were in the right place and time thanks to their perseveranc, in my opinione [essay writing service](http://essaywritingtime.com/) This series stands out as the biggest portion of building a scientific study. The resources devoted, time, method along with the impression connected with an piece of content throughout the controlled neighbourhood will depend on this part having been carried out appropriately. However, it can also be the maximum stressful position to plan. There are a number parameters that be dependent absolutely on you and the union from the preferred concept.

The languages of interest range from requirements to runtime languages, and include both general-purpose and domain-specific languages. Challenges related to engineering composable languages, semantic composition of languages and to reasoning about systems described using heterogeneous languages are of particular interest.

GEMOC 2013 will provide an open forum for sharing experiences, problems and solutions on the conjoint use of multiple modeling languages. This workshop will be the place where concrete artifacts, ideas and opinion are exchanged and constructive feedback provided. A major objective is to encourage collaborations and to start building a community that is focused on solving the problems arising from such a globalization of modeling languages.

**03:30-05:00:** Discussions on language composition and integration

The format of the workshop reflects the goals of the workshop: constructive feedback on submitted papers and models on the conjoint use of different modeling languages, collaboration, and community building. The format of the workshop is that of a working meeting. Hence, there is less of a focus on presentations and more focus on producing and documenting a research roadmap that identifies challenges, different forms of language integration, and relates existing solutions.

The workshop will consist of two sequential periods. A first one in which an introduction and short presentations of the accepted papers will be given; and a second one dedicated to open discussions of the presented contributions. We will lead the discussion towards a classification of existing and proposed forms of language integration but also a classification of common problem across the integrations. We will close the sessions by developing a work plan to publish the results of the discussion in a final workshop report.

## Call for Papers / Models

### Context and Motivation

Software intensive systems are becoming more and more complex and communicative. Consequently, the development of such systems requires the integration of many different concerns and skills. These concerns are usually covered by different languages, with specific concepts, technologies and abstraction levels. This multiplication of languages eases the development of a specific concern but raises language and technology integration problems at the different stages of the software life cycle. In order to reason about the global system, it becomes necessary to explicitly describe the different kinds of the relationships that can exist between the different languages used in the development of a complex system. To support effective language integration, there is a pressing need to reify and classify these relationships, as well as the language interactions that the relationships enable.

In this context, the workshop GEMOC 2013 aims to attract submissions that include outlines of language integration approaches, case studies, or that identify and discuss well defined problems about the management of relationships between heterogeneous modeling languages. The goal is to facilitate good discussions among the participants that lead to an initial classification of the kinds of language relationships and their management.

GEMOC 2013 is supported by [the GEMOC initiative]({{ site.baseurl }}/) that promotes research seeking to develop the necessary breakthroughs in software languages to support global software engineering, i.e., breakthroughs that lead to effective technologies supporting different forms of language integration, including language collaboration, interoperability and composability.

### Topics

The topics of interest for GEMOC 2013 include:

- Composability and interoperability of heterogeneous modeling languages
- Language integration challenges, from requirement to design, to analysis and simulation, to runtime.
- Model and metamodel composition
- Multi-paradigm modeling and simulation

Submissions describing practical and industrial experience related to the use of heterogeneous modeling languages are also encouraged, particularly in the following application domains:

- Cyber-Physical Systems, System of Systems
- Smart City, Smart Building, Home automation
- Complex Adaptive Systems
- Internet of Services, Internet of Things

### Types of Contributions

We expect as contributions, descriptions of case studies on coordinated use of multiple modeling languages, and/or descriptions of practical experience, opinions and related approaches. Authors will be invited to submit short papers describing (i) their language integration experience, or (ii) novel approaches for integrating modeling languages. Authors will also be invited to store full versions of models used to illustrate their novel approach or experience in the [Repository for Model Driven Development (ReMoDD)](http://www.cs.colostate.edu/remodd/v1/). This allows us to share the models with participants and the wider modeling community before and after the workshop.

Each contribution must be described in a short paper not exceeding 3-6 pages in the LNCS format. Each paper should describe problems, case studies, and solutions related to the topics of interest. Each paper is expected to highlight the relationships between modeling languages as well as their expected management.

Papers that describe novel or existing integration approaches should be accompanied by concrete artifacts, such as models (requirement, design, analysis, transformation, composition, etc.), stored in ReMoDD. Artifacts should illustrate any experience on the conjoint use of different modeling languages.

The paper selection process will be based on relevance to the topics for the workshop. All contributions will be reviewed and selected by the organizing and program committee.

### Submission

Each contribution must not exceed 3-6 pages in the LNCS format and [must be submitted electronically in pdf format via Easychair](https://www.easychair.org/conferences/?conf=gemoc2013).

In addition, the concrete models referenced in a contribution should be submitted to [ReMoDD](http://www.cs.colostate.edu/remodd/v1/content/gemocmodels2013). To do so, authors will have to do the following:
Create a ReMoDD account if they do not have one and and join the GEMOC@MODELS2013 group.
Create a Group Post (see right side of ReMoDD website) for the GEMOC@MODELS2013 group, provide a title, and attach your concrete artefacts file to this post.

### Publication

The accepted papers and the accepted models will be published just prior to the workshop on the workshop website and in ReMoDD, respectively. Similarly, final versions of models will also be published in ReMoDD shortly after the workshop.
Participants are strongly encouraged to participate in preparing the workshop report. This report will provide a classification of the possible relationships between modeling languages and a survey of integration approaches. The report will be published in CEUR, which is indexed by DBLP.
