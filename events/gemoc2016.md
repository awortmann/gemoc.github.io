## About the Workshop

To cope with complexity, modern software-intensive systems are often split in different concerns to serve the needs of diverse stakeholders. These different concerns are often associated with specialized description languages and technologies, which are based on concern-specific problems and solution concepts. Software developers are thus faced with the challenging task of integrating the different languages and associated technologies used to produce software artifacts in the different concern spaces.
The proposed GEMOC 2016 will be a full-day workshop that brings together researchers and practitioners in the modeling languages community to discuss the challenges associated with integrating multiple, heterogeneous modeling languages. The languages of interest range from requirements, to design and runtime languages, and include both general-purpose and domain-specific languages. Challenges related to engineering composable languages, well-formed semantic composition of languages and reasoning about systems described using heterogeneous languages are of particular interest. Following the three previous editions, a major objective is to continue collaborations and to expand a community that is focused on solving the problems arising from the *globalization of modeling languages*; i.e., the use of multiple DSLs to support coordinated development of diverse aspects of a system.

## Program

**Session 1**: 9:00 – 10:30
9:00 – 9:15     Opening

09:15-10:15: Keynote (chair: *J. Gray*)

**Towards Live DSLs by Tijs van der Storm**

Domain-specific languages (DSLs) promise improved development productivity and software quality, by raising the level of abstraction and using notations closer to the problem domain. However, DSLs also increase the distance between what a developer writes, and what is executing on the machine. Live programming is a style of development aimed at eliminating slow edit-compile-run cycles so that developers may enjoy immediate feedback on their actions. In this talk I’ll explore what live programming can mean for DSLs and modeling languages, using example languages for state machines, questionnaires, and meta programming. In addition, I’ll sketch future direction on how language workbenches could support development of live DSLs.

The format of the workshop reflects the goals of the workshop: constructive feedback on submitted papers and models on the conjoint use of different modeling languages, collaboration, and community building. The format of the workshop is that of a working meeting. Hence, there is less of a focus on presentations and more focus on producing and documenting a research roadmap that identifies challenges, different forms of language integration, and relates existing solutions.

The workshop will consist of a morning session in which a keynote and short presentations of the accepted papers will be given. A significant amount of time will be reserved for discussion of each paper and their relations to each other. The afternoon will be devoted to a working session dedicated to open discussions of the presented contributions and other topics suggested by the participants. We will lead the discussion towards a classification of existing and proposed forms of language integration, as well as a description of the language interfaces required in the context of the globalization of modeling languages. We will close with a working session to develop a plan to publish the results of the discussion in a final workshop report.

### Context and Motivation

Software intensive systems are becoming more complex, driven by the need to integrate across multiple concerns and communicative. Consequently, the development of such systems requires the integration of many different concerns and skills. These concerns are usually covered by different languages, with specific concepts, technologies and abstraction levels.  This multiplication of languages

Throughout reputation for scientific discipline it is often said that the favorable developments originate from researchers who required their selves appropriate requests. Not only because of this, many of these individuals were fortunate and were in the right place and time thanks to their perseveranc, in my opinione [buy an essay](https://senperfect.com/buy-essay-paper-online.php) This series could be the primary aspect of setting up a study. The resources spent, time, technique including the shock of some content page contained in the scientific neighborhood rely on this cycle having been carried out properly. On the other hand, also, it is one of the very hard level to plan. There are numerous variables that count altogether on you and your partnership along with the picked out topic.

eases the development related to one specific concern but raises language and technology integration problems at the different stages of the software life cycle. In order to reason about the global system, it becomes necessary to explicitly describe the different kinds of relationships that exist between the different languages used in the development of a complex system. To support effective language integration, there is a pressing need to reify and classify these relationships, as well as the language interactions that the relationships enable. In this context, the proposed GEMOC 2016 workshop aims to attract submissions that outline language integration approaches and case studies that identify and discuss well-defined problems about the management of relationships between heterogeneous modeling languages. The goal is to facilitate deep discussions among the participants that lead to an initial classification of the kinds of language relationships and their management.

 

This proposed 2016 edition of the GEMOC workshop will follow the successful previous three editions at MODELS 2013 in Miami, FL, USA (Cf.[{{ site.baseurl }}{% link events/gemoc2013.md %}]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link events/gemoc2013.md %})), at MODELS 2014 in Valencia, Spain (Cf.[{{ site.baseurl }}{% link events/gemoc2014.md %}]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link events/gemoc2014.md %})) and at MODELS 2015 in Ottawa, Canada (Cf. [{{ site.baseurl }}{% link events/gemoc2015.md %}]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link events/gemoc2015.md %})).

The proposed 2016 edition will complete the state-of-the-art and practice initiated during the last years. This edition will also continue to investigate the language interfaces required in the context of the globalization of modeling languages. Additionally, it will study the possible relationships with the viewpoint engineering and the notion of multi-paradigm modeling. It will also strengthen the community that broadens the current DSML research focus beyond the development of independent DSMLs to a research focus that provides support for globalized DSMLs.
GEMOC 2016 is supported by the GEMOC initiative ({http://gemoc.org}), which promotes research seeking to develop the necessary breakthroughs in software languages to support global software engineering, i.e., breakthroughs that lead to effective technologies supporting different forms of language integration, including language collaboration, interoperability and composability, as well as the related social coordination between developers that use different languages.

 

### Topics

The topics of interest for GEMOC 2016 include:

- Composability and interoperability of heterogeneous modeling languages
- Language integration challenges, from requirement to design, for analysis and simulation, during runtime, etc.
- Model and metamodel composition
- Language interface, viewpoint
- Heterogeneous modeling and simulation
- Multi-paradigm modeling

- Internet of Services, Internet of Things
- Complex Adaptive Systems
- Smart City, Smart Building, Home automation

### Types of Contributions

As contributions, we expect descriptions of case studies on the coordinated use of multiple modeling languages, and/or descriptions of practical experience, opinions and related approaches. Authors will be invited to submit short papers describing (i) their language integration experience, or (ii) novel approaches for integrating modeling languages.

Each contribution must be from 6 to 10 pages long in the LNCS format. Each paper should describe problems, case studies, or solutions related to the topics of interest. Each paper is expected to highlight the relationships between modeling languages, as well as their management.

Papers that describe use cases, or novel integration approaches can be accompanied by concrete artifacts, such as models (requirements, design, analysis, transformation, composition, etc.). In this case, the concrete artifacts can be stored in [the Repository for Model-Driven Development](http://www.cs.colostate.edu/remodd/v1/) (ReMoDD).

Submitted articles must not have been previously published or currently submitted for publication elsewhere. The program chairs will apply the principles of the ACM Plagiarism Policy throughout the submission and review process. All contributions will be reviewed and selected by the program committee members.
