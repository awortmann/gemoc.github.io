## About the Workshop

Modern software-intensive systems serve diverse stakeholder groups and thus must address a variety of stakeholder concerns. These concern spaces are often associated with specialized description languages and technologies that are based on concern-specific problem and solution concepts. Software developers are thus faced with the challenging task of integrating the different languages and associated technologies used to produce software artifacts in the different concern spaces.

GlobalDSL 2013 is a full-day workshop that will bring together researchers and practitioners in the programming and modeling languages communities to discuss the challenges associated with integrating multiple, heterogeneous software languages. The languages of interest range from requirements to runtime languages, and include domain-specific modeling and programming languages. Challenges related to engineering composable languages, semantic composition of languages and to reasoning about systems described using heterogeneous languages are of particular interest.

GlobalDSL 2013 is supported by [the initiative GEMOC]({{ site.baseurl }}/) that promotes research and development work exploring the necessary breakthrough in software languages to support global software engineering, i.e., collaboration, interoperability and composability in software languages.

### Topics of interest include

- Composability, interoperability of (domain-specific) languages,
- Modularity, reuse, and variability of (domain-specific) languages,
- Heterogeneous simulation, combination of Validation & Verification techniques.

Paper describing practical and industrial experiences related to the use of heterogeneous software languages are also encouraged, particularly in the following application domains:

- Cyber-Physical Systems, System of Systems,
- Smart City, Smart Building, Home automation,
- Complex Adaptive Systems,
- Internet of Services, and Internet of Things.

## Program

The workshop will consist of a keynote, paper presentations (long and short papers), and a panel discussion. We expect the short paper presentations to be ongoing research where interested workshop participants may get involved in the research activities.

- 09:00-09:15: Workshop opening

- 09:15-10:30: Keynote (chair: B. Combemale)

  > ## Keynote by [Prof. Dr. Bernhard Rumpe](http://www.se-rwth.de/~rumpe/): “[Compositional Model Based Software Development]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link pub/20130702-GlobalDSL13/13.07.02.CompositionalMBSE.en.pdf %})“
  >
  > *Model based software development promises to strongly improve efficiency and quality in software development projects. However, MBSE has not yet delivered it’s promises yet. *In the talk, we examine the current state and problems of MBSE and discuss a number of approaches to tackle those. In particular, we discuss how to make use of models in large development projects, where a set of heterogenous models of different languages needs is developed and needs to fit together. A model based development process (both with UML as well as a domain specific modeling language (DSML)) heavily relies on modeling core parts of a system in a redundant free form, having compositional generators to early and repeatedly cut code and tests from these models. We in detail discuss compositionality on models and heterogeneous modeling languages and how it supports agile development as well as reuse of language and tooling infrastructures. And we show what the current status of compositionality is vs. a bunch of interesting languages given. We finally demonstrate what has already been achieved in the language workbench MontiCore developed in our group over the recent years.

## Call for Papers

### Types of Contributions

- Full Papers, not exceeding 6 pages in the ACM format contribute research papers and experience reports in line with the topics of GlobalDSL 2013. They present contributions in the field of programming or modeling language composition.
- Short Papers, not exceeding 4 pages in the ACM format, present position statements addressing the workshop topics. These papers intend to stimulate discussions during the workshop.

The paper selection process will be based on the novelty of the ideas or solutions, the impact on language composition, and relevance to the topics for the workshop. All papers will be reviewed by at least three members of the program committee. In order to facilitate a comprehensive and open minded online decision on paper acceptance, all papers and reviews are accessible to all PC members (exempt those reporting a conflict of interest).

### Submission and Publication

All papers have to be submitted electronically in pdf format via Easychair: [https://www.easychair.org/conferences/?conf=globaldsl2013](https://www.easychair.org/conferences/?conf=globaldsl2013). All papers of the workshop GlobalDSL 2013 have to follow the ACM format. Details about the required format can be found at: [http://www.acm.org/sigs/publications/proceedings-templates](http://www.acm.org/sigs/publications/proceedings-templates). At least one author for each accepted paper should register for the workshop at the conference and present the paper.

All accepted papers will be published in the ACM Digital Library.

## Important Dates
