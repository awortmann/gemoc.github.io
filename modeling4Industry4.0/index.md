# MODELS'17 Industry 4.0 Systematic Mapping Study

This website accompanies a systematic mapping study investigating research 
in modeling in the context of Industry 4.0.

Industry 4.0 is a term coined 2011 at Hannover fair as the fourth 
industrial revolution that arises from interconecting all parts of the 
manufacturing value-added chain. It also has become the title of a 
[high tech strategy project of the German Federal Ministry of Education and Research](https://www.bmbf.de/de/zukunftsprojekt-industrie-4-0-848.htm]) 
and can be defined as

- "the next phase in the digitization of the manufacturing sector, driven by four disruptions: [...] data volumes, computational power, and connectivity; the emergence of analytics and business-intelligence capabilities; new forms of human-machine interaction […]; and improvements in transferring digital instructions to the physical world, such as advanced robotics and 3-D printing.” ([McKinsey](http://www.mckinsey.com/business-functions/operations/our-insights/manufacturings-next-act)) or 

- "connected, intelligent products that communicate with users, new digital business models that harness collected data to offer additional services and as-a-service products, products on the assembly line that tell shop floor machinery how they are to be processed. The core of Industry 4.0 is highly intelligent connected systems that create a fully digital value chain, the 4th industrial revolution enabled by the Industrial Internet of Things." ([Accenture](https://www.accenture.com/us-en/digital-industry-index))

We aim to characterize the state of the art of Model-Based Systems 
Engineering for the smart factory through a 
[systematic mapping study](http://robertfeldt.net/publications/petersen_ease08_sysmap_studies_in_se.pdf) 
on this topic. Adopting a detailed search strategy over multiple digital 
libraries, 1466 papers -- published until February 2017 -- were initially 
identified as possibly relevant. Of these, 222 papers were selected and 
categorized using a particular classification scheme. In the study, we 
present the concerns addressed by modeling community for Industry 4.0, how 
these are investigated, where these are published, and by whom. The 
resulting research landscape can help to understand, guide, and compare 
research in this field. In particular, this paper identifies the 
Industry 4.0 challenges addressed  by the modeling community but also the 
challenges that seems to be less investigated.

For better transparency and replicability, this website provides

- a list of the [initial 1466 publications](./data/2017-corpus.xlsx) and
- a [sanitized list of the 222 included publications](./data/2017-included.xlsx).

We hope that this data supports better comprehension of the systematic mapping study and of its results.

# 2018 Mapping Study Update

We updated the study to include results until March 2018. For this update, 
we investigated 809 additional publications out of which 126 publications 
were included into the mapping study. Below you find the updated data sets:

- a list of the [total 2275 investigated publications](./data/2018-corpus.xlsx) and
- a [sanitized list of the total 348 included publications](./data/2018-included.xlsx).
