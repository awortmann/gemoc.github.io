The final workshop of [the ANR project GEMOC]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link projects/anr-ins/index.md %}) (grant #ANR-12-INSE-0011) has brought together people from academia and industry to discuss recent progresses related to heterogeneous modeling and simulation in software and systems engineering. The scientific and technological breakthroughs achieved during the ANR project GEMOC have been presented, and demonstrations of [the GEMOC studio]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link studio.html %}) have been given.

Different talks presented the scientific and technological achievements of the project. Demonstrations of the GEMOC studio have been given to develop and coordinate executable (domain-specific) modeling languages, and deploy the corresponding modeling workbenches supported by simulation, graphical animation and omniscient debugging facilities.

The workshop took place in **Paris**, on **Thursday, March 17th, 2016**:

Laboratoire d’Informatique de Paris 6 (LIP6)
Tour 25-26, salle 105
4 Place Jussieu, 75252 Paris Cedex 05, France

The registration is free but mandatory. Please, **confirm your participation** by email to [Benoit Combemale](mailto:benoit.combemale@inria.fr).
